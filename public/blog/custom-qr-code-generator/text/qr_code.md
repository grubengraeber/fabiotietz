## 🤔 Why I Built My Own QR Code Generator  
When I first tried creating a customized QR code, I didn’t realize there was a difference between **static** and **dynamic** QR codes. This led to a frustrating discovery I’d like to share to save you some trouble!  

### 📖 Understanding Static vs. Dynamic QR Codes  
- **Dynamic QR Codes**: These codes are popular for marketing because they allow for tracking and link redirection. However, some services create a “free” dynamic code, only to charge later to keep it active. You might embed a QR code in an important place, like your resume, then find out it’s disabled unless you pay. 😠  
- **Static QR Codes**: Static QR codes are simpler—they permanently contain the info you enter, whether it’s a URL, text, email, or vCard. No redirects, no tracking, no hidden fees. They just work, forever. 👍  

After getting hit with unexpected charges to keep my QR code functional, I decided to build a **free, customizable QR code generator** that gives users full control from the start.

## 🔮 The Future of QR Code Customization  
While standard QR codes are incredibly useful, I’m always thinking about new ways to make them even more exciting. Here are a few customization ideas that I’m considering for future updates:

- **✨ 3D QR Codes**: Integrate 3D elements to give QR codes a more modern, dynamic look. This would be great for brands looking to stand out even further.

## ⚠️ QR Code Scams to Watch Out For  
With QR codes becoming so widespread, it’s essential to stay vigilant against scams that exploit them. Here are a few risks to watch out for:  
- **🚗 Charging Stations**: In some places, scammers place fake QR codes over the real ones on e-mobility charging stations. Scanning these codes can lead to phishing sites that trick users into entering payment details.  
- **🚨 Fake URLs**: QR codes can link to harmful websites, so always double-check the URL that opens when you scan a code. Make sure it matches what you expect, especially if you’re entering personal information.  
- **🛍️ Payment and Retail Scams**: Fraudulent QR codes are sometimes added to flyers, advertisements, or posters, redirecting users to payment sites that look authentic. Always verify the source, especially if the QR code requests payment info.  

**Pro Tip**: Use a reputable QR code scanner that shows the URL before proceeding to ensure safety.

## 🛠️ Behind the Scenes: How QR Codes Are Created  
QR codes (quick-response codes) look simple, but the technology behind them is fascinating. Here’s a peek into how they’re generated:  
- **Data Encoding**: QR codes store data in a series of tiny squares, alternating from bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom in two-pixel-wide columns.  
- **Error Correction**: QR codes can include error correction, so they’ll still work even if up to 30% of the code is damaged or covered by a logo.  
- **Customization**: Changing colors and adding logos doesn’t impact how the QR code works because the data encoding is distinct from the visuals. So you can get creative without sacrificing functionality.  

This process allows us to add logos, change colors, and ensure each QR code is still scannable.
