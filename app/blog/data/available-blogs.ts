# 🎉 Create Custom QR Codes for Free – No Hidden Fees, Just Pure Convenience! 🚀

Let’s take a moment to appreciate genuinely free tools on the internet—those that don’t come with hidden costs or sneaky tricks. I’m a fan of quality products, but I also love resources that offer real value without surprises! 🎁

🤔 Why I Built My Own QR Code Generator

When I first tried creating a customized QR code, I didn’t realize there was a difference between static and dynamic QR codes. This led to a frustrating discovery I’d like to share to save you some trouble!

📖 Understanding Static vs. Dynamic QR Codes

    •	Dynamic QR Codes: These codes are popular with marketing because they can track clicks and redirect users. But some sites let you create a dynamic code for free, only to charge you later to keep it active! You might embed a QR code in an important place, like your resume, then find out it’s disabled unless you pay. 😠

    •	Static QR Codes: Static QR codes are simpler—they permanently contain the info you enter, whether it’s a URL, text, email, or vCard. No redirects, no tracking, no hidden fees. They just work, forever. 👍

I had to learn this the hard way! After being prompted to pay to keep my QR code active, I decided to build a free, customizable QR code generator that gives users full control from the start.

    •	Generate static QR codes for websites, text, emails, and vCards—no strings attached! 🆓
    •	Add Your Logo or Image: Customize your QR codes with your logo or an image in the center for a unique look. 🎨
    •	Custom Colors: Choose colors for the QR background and pixels to fit your brand or style. 🌈
