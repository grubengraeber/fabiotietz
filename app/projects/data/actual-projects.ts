      # My Portfolio Journey

In the year **2024**, I decided to create a portfolio website since I was about to become a freelancer.  
Everybody needs a portfolio website, right? I also wanted to showcase my projects and skills, especially as a **career changer** with limited professional experience in the field of Software Development.

## Goals for the Website

- **Performance:** A fast and accessible website.
- **Responsive Design:** Look great on all devices.
- **Skill Development:** Deepen my knowledge of **TypeScript**.
- **Aesthetics:** Implement animations and visually appealing components.

## Technologies Used

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/):** For building the website.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** For efficient and responsive styling.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/):** To enhance my coding skills and ensure type safety.
- **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/):** For reusable components.
- **[Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/):** To create smooth animations.

## Features

- **Custom Design:** I designed a custom favicon and logo to improve my design skills.
- **Dark Mode:** Because who doesnâ€™t love a good dark mode these days?

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Iâ€™m planning to:

- Launch my **[personal blog](https://fabiotietz.com/blog)**.
- Showcase a few more exciting projects Iâ€™m working on.

Definitely stay tuned for more updates!

        In the year 2024 I decided to create a portfolio website since I was about to become a freelancer. 
        Everybody needs a portfolio website, right? Also I wanted to show off my projects and skills, 
        since I'm a career changer and I have not that much professional experience in the field of Software Development.

        I wanted to create a website that is fast, accessible and looks good on all devices. So I decided to use Next.js, 
        with the help of Tailwind CSS for styling. I also wanted to deepen my TypeScript skills, so I decided to use it for this project.
        Additionally I wanted components that would animate and also look good on mobile devices, so I decided to use shadcn-ui and Framer Motion for that.

        To better my design skills I came up with a custom favicon and logo design. And since the dark mode is all the rage, I decided to implement that as well.
        Next up is my personal blog and a few more projects I'm working on.
        Definetly stay tuned for more!

      # Word: A Support App for a Guessing Game

**Word** is a supporting app designed to enhance a fun guessing game and (hopefully) help me win more often against my wife! ðŸŽ®

## The Game

- **Objective:** Both players get a four-letter word and must guess the other player's word.  
- **How It Works:**  
  1. Each round, a player guesses a four-letter word.  
  2. The other player responds with a number (0â€“4) indicating how many letters are in the correct position.  
  3. The first player to guess the opponent's word wins the round.

## Why I Built It

My wife has won a few too many rounds, so I decided to create an app to level the playing field.  

- **Features:**  
  - The app generates a four-letter word for the game.  
  - It helps me deduce my wife's word using:  
    - A **German dictionary library for Node.js**.  
    - A **simple algorithm** to optimize guesses.  

## About the App

- **Web Application:** Compatible with all common screen sizes.  
- **Smart Evolution:** The app will get smarter over time with new features planned to make it even more effective.

Stay tuned as I continue to refine and improve Word!

        The Game: Both players get a four letter word and have to guess the other players word.
        Each round each player guesses a word and the other player answers with a number between 0 and 4.
        The number indicates how many letters of the guessed word are in the other players word AND are at the correct position.
        The player who guesses the word first wins the round.

        My wife won a couple of times now, so I decided to create an app to help me win more often.
        The app generates a four letter word and helps me to guess the word of my wife by using a german dictionary library for node.js and a simple algorithm.

        The app is a web application that fits on any common screen.
        It should get smarter over time with more features to come.
